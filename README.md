osu-sh
======

Speed hack for the game "osu!". 

Makes use of dll injection to trick the "clock" of osu. The most notable thing you can do is play the game at 0.9 speed with dt mod and have it still register as playing with double time.

One quirk -- osu apparently checks for the cheat engine process at submit time so if it's open it doesn't submit; but it can be bypassed by renaming the exe o_O.
